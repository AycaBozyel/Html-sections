      <b>StoryLine : </b>An ancient <strong>Ring</strong> thought lost for
      centuries has been found, and through a strange twist of fate has been
      given to a small Hobbit named <i>Frodo.</i> When
      <em>Gandalf</em> discovers the Ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark
      Lord Sauron, Frodo must make an epic quest to the Cracks of Doom in order
      to destroy it. However, he does not go alone. He is joined by Gandalf,
      Legolas the elf, Gimli the Dwarf, Aragorn, Boromir, and his three Hobbit
      friends Merry, Pippin, and Samwise. Through mountains, snow, darkness,
      forests, rivers and plains, facing evil and danger at every corner the
      Fellowship of the Ring must go. Their quest to destroy the One Ring is the
      only hope for the end of the Dark Lords reign.
