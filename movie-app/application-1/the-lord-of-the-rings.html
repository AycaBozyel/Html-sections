      <b>StoryLine : </b>An ancient Ring thought lost for centuries has been
      found, and through a strange twist of fate has been given to a small
      Hobbit named Frodo. When Gandalf discovers the Ring is in fact the One
      Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron, Frodo must make an epic quest to the Cracks
      of Doom in order to destroy it. However, he does not go alone. He is
      joined by Gandalf, Legolas the elf, Gimli the Dwarf, Aragorn, Boromir, and
      his three Hobbit friends Merry, Pippin, and Samwise. Through mountains,
      snow, darkness, forests, rivers and plains, facing evil and danger at
      every corner the Fellowship of the Ring must go. Their quest to destroy
      the One Ring is the only hope for the end of the Dark Lords reign.
